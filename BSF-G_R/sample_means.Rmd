##Description
When used to sample [B;D]:\
Y - FL' - Z_2W = XB + ZD + E, vec(E)~N(0,kron(Psi_E,In))\ 
Note: conditioning on F, L and W.\
The vector [b_j;d_j] is sampled simultaneously. Each trait is sampled separately because their conditional posteriors factor into independent MVNs.\
note:svd_Design_Ainv has parameters to diagonalize mixed model equations for fast inversion: \ 
inv(a*blkdiag(fixed_effects.cov,Ainv) + b*[X; Z_1][X; Z_1]') = Q*diag(1./(a.*s1+b.*s2))*Q'\
Qt_Design = Q'*Design, which doesn't change each iteration. Design = [X;Z_1]\
\
Function also used to sample W:\
Y - FL' - XB - ZD = Z_2W + E, vec(E)~N(0,kron(Psi_E,In))\ 
Here, conditioning is on B and D.
